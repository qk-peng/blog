            The only survivor couldn't tell us why the zimtrum sank. It seems that the speed of the ship's sinking is very fast. This theory can be supported by a lot of debris. However, the specific cause of the cracking could not be determined. No drastic weather changes were reported in the radio navigation signal area that day. Survivors' estimates of the weather based on their impressions are unreliable. Weather was at best one of the factors that led to the sinking of the ship. The reason may be inside the ship. The explosion of the boiler may be serious, but the survivors believe that there is a mechanical explosion. The ship has lived for 29 years (made in 1948 at erlanson and skank shipyards in Malmo) and was renovated in 1970. Bad weather and fatigue of the ship's structure may have contributed to the accident, but this is only speculation. There were no reports of accidents with other vessels in that area that day, so there was no possibility of collision with other vessels. There is a possibility of collision with the wreckage, but this cannot be confirmed.
